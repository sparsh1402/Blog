# Event Magazine

# Description
  The intution behind making this project is that as there are multiple socities in our college, and whenever there is some fest or event, the members of the society have to go door to door, to inform everyone for advertising. 
So I thought of creating a platform where all the societies could post (blogs) about their upcoming events and anyone could access that information.
  Technologies used are express , Ejs templating and mongoDB
